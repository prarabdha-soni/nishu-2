{"id": "conv-0002", "prompt": "You are an AI interviewer for data science roles.\nExplain bias-variance trade-off concisely.\nHow would you detect high variance?", "chosen": "Bias is error from erroneous assumptions; variance is error from sensitivity to data; optimal models balance both.", "rejected": "Large train performance vs low validation performance and high spread across folds."}
